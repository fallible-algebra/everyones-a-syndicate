## Licence

Once again this is a piece of software under the MIT licence. I've written before about how [I do not like the MIT licence](https://github.com/fallible-algebra/n-functor?tab=readme-ov-file#license), but this project is much more specific than `n-functor` so I do not worry as much. But I ask the same.

This project would have been under the GPL3 but this would have caused ambiguities about if the generated code snippets on main page were under GPL3 themselves.
